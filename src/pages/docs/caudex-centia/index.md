## New Stuff here Centia?

A role-playing game is an interactive story like a novel or a - except the actions of the players change the course of the adventure. players interact with the universe through imaginary extensions of called characters. These characters are people living in the that the players control. Unlike regular games, RPGs change each time play because the story is separate from the rules, so each time you use a story the adventure changes. With role-playing games you never have the adventure twice. That is what makes role-playing such a vivid, exciting unique experience - you never know what to expect.
